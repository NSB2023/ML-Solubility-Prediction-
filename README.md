# ML-Solubility-Prediction :
This project is about to predict the aqueous solubility of chemical compounds using machine learning. Leveraging the Delaney Solubility Dataset, the project demonstrates 
how molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, logp, number of rotatable bonds, and aromaticity can be used to build predictive models for solubility.
I used linear regression and random forest and later showed their evaluation.

The project provides a clear workflow for loading, preprocessing, and analyzing chemical data, followed by training and comparing machine learning models to
predict solubility. It is accessible for both beginners and experienced people interested in cheminformatics and predictive modeling.

Evaluation :
For evaluation i have used Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) matrics and showed their results.

Future work can be done on this project.
